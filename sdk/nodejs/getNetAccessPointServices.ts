/**
 * Provides information about Net access point services.

 * For more information on this resource, see the [User Guide](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-VPC-Endpoints.html).\
 * For more information on this resource actions, see the [API documentation](https://docs.outscale.com/api#3ds-outscale-api-netaccesspoint).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### List all services available to create Net access points
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as outscale from "@pulumi/outscale";
 *
 * const all-services = outscale.getNetAccessPointServices({});
 * ```
 * ### List one or more services according to their service IDs
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as outscale from "@pulumi/outscale";
 *
 * const services01 = outscale.getNetAccessPointServices({
 *     filters: [{
 *         name: "service_ids",
 *         values: [
 *             "pl-12345678",
 *             "pl-12345679",
 *         ],
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### List one or more services according to their service names
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as outscale from "@pulumi/outscale";
 *
 * const services02 = outscale.getNetAccessPointServices({
 *     filters: [{
 *         name: "service_names",
 *         values: ["com.outscale.eu-west-2.api"],
